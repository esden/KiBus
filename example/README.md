The bus definition json file has to be present inside the KiCad project directory.

The name of the file has to be "projectname"-lm.json

The file contains the following structure:
* Bus name
  * Wire name
    * Net name
    * Net name
  * Wire name
    * Net name
    * Net name
* Bus name
  * Wire name
    * Net name
    * Net name
  * Wire name
    * Net name
    * Net name

See example file included in this directory.

Yes it would be nice to create the definition file through the GUI. One day we will add that. :D
